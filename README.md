background-color-changer:
This is the first project I've worked on where I've utilized JavaScript and DOM manipulation to make an interactive webpage that changes color. Yellow, black, light blue, and light green are the four color buttons that are displayed on the website. The webpage's background color changes to the user's specified color when they click on any of these buttons. 

Through the usage of JavaScript, I was able to update the DOM dynamically by catching button click events and changing the backdrop. Through this project, I gained a thorough understanding of how to manipulate HTML elements using JavaScript and style them using CSS to improve user experience and interactivity.
